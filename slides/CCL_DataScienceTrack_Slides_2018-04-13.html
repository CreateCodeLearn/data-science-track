# What is Data Science?

_Data science [...] is an **interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, and systems** to extract **knowledge or insights from data**[...]_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science))

# What is Data Science?

_Data science [...] is an **interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, and systems** to extract **knowledge or insights from data**[...]_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science))

_It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of_
* _mathematics_, 
* _statistics_, 
* _information science_, and 
* _computer science_, in particular from the subdomains of 
    * _machine learning_, 
    * _classification_, 
    * _cluster analysis_, 
    * _data mining_, 
    * _databases_, and 
    * _visualization._

# Learning Goals 

* #### Setting up a computational environment for data science projects
* #### Basic skills using git
* #### Basic+ skills using Python
* #### Navigating the Python ecosystem (data science stack)
* #### Literate Programming using Jupyter Notebooks
* #### Code refactoring
* #### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* #### Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning)
* #### Generating reports

---

# Software and Tools 

#### Computational environment: 
* ##### Python 3.6, `conda` package manager, IDE (e.g. Spyder, Atom or PyCharm)

#### Version control
* ##### `git` and github

#### Python ecosystem
* ##### `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`, among others

#### Literate Programming
* ##### Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown

#### Reporting
* ##### `nbconvert` and `nbsphinx`

---

# Capstone Project

### Run a data science project on a real world data set

Data source: [kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

* Pick a dataset of interest (Regression, Classification, Time Series Analysis, Recommender System, Natural Language Processing, ...)
* EDA and data cleansing
* Find an interesting question and apply machine learning algorithm(s) to answer the question
	* Model selection
	* Hyperparameter tuning
	* Reporting and visualization of the model results
* Generate a html-based report

# Learning Resources I (Coding)

An extensive list of learning resources is made available on [github](https://github.com/CreateCodeLearn/data-science-track/blob/master/learning_resources.md). 

In order to get started with __Python__ we in particular recommend the resources listed below:

* Python course [@Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)
* _Programming for Everybody_ [@Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) 
* _Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python_ [@EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11)
* _Intro to Python for Data Science_ [@Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

---

# Learning Resources II (Statistics)

If you feel somehow comfortable with Python try to get familiar with the buzzwords below:

* Population and sampling statistics
* Central Limit Theorem and confidence intervals
* Multivariate statistics
* Predictive modeling and machine learning
* Supervised Learning
* Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
* Regularization
* Overfitting
* Bias-Variance trade-off
* Model selection
* Decision Trees and Random Forests
* Model Evaluation
